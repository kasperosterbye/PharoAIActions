# Examples of getAIComment

```
(Dictionary >> #at:put: ) getAIComment.
```

And the response is:

"Set the value at key to be anObject. If key is not found, create a new entry for key and set its value to anObject."

Then one can write "EpLog getAIComment" to get the mistral comment for EdLog class (Results below).
Finally one can simply write: "'AIActions' getAIComment.", which will generate a comment for the package for AIActions (this code).
These two examples are shown below.

In addtion, it is possible to change the language of the comment, so if you want to get an overall comment in French, you type:

```
AIACommentBuilding language: 'French'.
EpLog getAIComment.
```

## Class Comment for `EpLog`

# Package Comment for AIActions

The `AIActions` package is designed to facilitate the generation and management of comments for various elements within the Pharo programming environment. This package leverages AI-driven tools to automate the creation of class comments, method comments, and package comments, ensuring that documentation is both comprehensive and consistent.

## Overview

The `AIActions` package comprises several key classes, each serving a specific purpose in the automated generation of comments. These classes interact with external AI models to generate comments based on the source code and context of the elements they are documenting. The package is structured to be modular, allowing for easy extension and customization.

## Key Classes

### AIACommentBuilding

The `AIACommentBuilding` class serves as a base class for building comments. It provides a framework for setting and getting prompts and responses, which are essential for interacting with AI models. This class is designed to be subclassed, allowing for the creation of more specific comment builders.

- `response`: Gets the AI-generated response.
- `response: anObject`: Sets the AI-generated response.
- `system`: Gets the system prompt.
- `system: anObject`: Sets the system prompt.
- `getComment: aPackageName`: Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses.

### OllamaModelsApi

The `OllamaModelsApi` class is responsible for interacting with the Ollama API to generate comments. It handles the construction of API requests, sending them to the server, and processing the responses.
