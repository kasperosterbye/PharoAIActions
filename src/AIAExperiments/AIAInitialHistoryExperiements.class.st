# Class Comment for AIAInitialHistoryExperiements

The `AIAInitialHistoryExperiements` class is designed to explore the impact of different Chat history structures on the responses generated by various Large Language Models (LLMs). The experiments focus on the use of system messages in the Chat history and their effect on the LLM's responses.

## Key Features

- **System vs. User Instructions**: Tests the difference between using system messages and user messages to provide instructions to the LLM.
- **Background Context**: Evaluates how providing background context (such as source code) affects the LLM's responses.
- **Response Analysis**: Compares the responses from different LLMs to identify patterns and differences in their behaviour.

## Usage Example

The following example demonstrates how to run a system test for a specific LLM model and inspect the results:

```st
""Create an instance of the experiment class""
experiment := AIAInitialHistoryExperiements new.

""Run a system test for a specific LLM model (e.g., MistralApi)""
experiment systemTestFor: MistralApi.

""Inspect the results""
experiment llmResults
```

This will execute a system test using the specified LLM model and store the results in the `llmResults` instance variable, which can then be inspected.

## Design Decisions

- **Fluid Syntax**: The class is designed to support fluid syntax for easy scripting and interactive use.
- **Class Builder**: The class builder pattern is used to create and manage class definitions without immediately installing them in the system.
- **Comparison**: The class can compare old and new class definitions to determine the required changes for installation.
- **Extensibility**: The class can be extended by using different builder enhancers to customise the class creation process.

## Future Improvements

- **API Alignment**: Revisit the API to align it more closely with the default values of the class.
- **Builder Refinement**: Consider revisiting the need for fluid class builders and refining their API for better usability and maintainability.

This class is part of the `AIAExperiments` package and is tagged with 'HistoryExperiements'.
